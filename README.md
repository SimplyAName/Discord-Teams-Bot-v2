# **Discord Teams Bot V2**

This bot uses Discord.js to interact with the Discord API. 

I designed this bot to replace my old Teams bot as it hasn't been maintained in sometime and new standard and supports for slash command has come out since.

This bot now supports slash commands and is easier to develop and extend if required.

## **How to use**

### <ins>Step up:<ins>

1) Create a file named `.env`
2) Add these two properties to it:
``` properties
CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_BOT_TOKEN
```

> [Click here for a guide](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html "Discord.js bot building guide") to explain where you can get the values for these variables. 
>
> You should only need to look in the installation section but further explain on what these variables are for is further in.

3) Run `node .` at the root of the project

4) Your bot should now be running!

5) Add it to your server and voila you have a new Teams bot!
