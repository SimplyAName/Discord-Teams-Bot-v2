# **Discord Teams Bot V2**

This bot is design to replace my old Teams bot. 

This bot now supports slash commands and is easier to develop and extend if required.

## **How to use**

This bot uses Discord.js to interact with the Discord API. 

To run the bot enter your bot token in the config.json and then use `node .` in your terminal to run the bot.

Once the bot is running you just need to add it to your server and voila you have a new Teams bot!
